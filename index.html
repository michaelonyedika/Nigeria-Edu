              <h3>Inadequate Infrastructure</h3>
              <p>
                Many Nigerian schools lack basic infrastructure, such as well-equipped classrooms, libraries, and laboratories. This hampers the learning experience for students and educators alike.

              <h3>Quality Teachers</h3>
              <p>
                Quality education starts with quality teachers. Yet, Nigeria faces a shortage of qualified educators, and some teachers lack the necessary training to deliver effective lessons.

              <h3>Access to Education</h3>
              <p>
                Millions of children, particularly those in rural and underserved areas, still lack access to education. Poverty, gender discrimination, and distance from schools are among the barriers they face.

              <p>
                A relevant curriculum is essential to prepare students for the job market. Our current curriculum may not always align with the demands of the modern workforce.
